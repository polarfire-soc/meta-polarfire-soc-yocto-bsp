# MPFS-DEV-KIT User Guide

## Overview
The HiFive Unleashed Platform™ is purpose-built to emulate most of the functionality of the upcoming
PolarFire SoC FPGA, which will be the industry’s first RISC-V based FPGA SoC.       
This guide describes the MPFS-DEV-KIT, board setup, and installation steps to get the HiFive Unleashed
platform boot Linux. New IP cores can be ported on the PolarFire FPGA with the Libero SoC PolarFire
Design Suite. For more details on the design suite, see section FPGA Design in Libero.        

### HiFive Unleashed Platform (MPFS-DEV-KIT)   
The HiFive Unleashed Platform consists of the SiFive’s HiFive Unleashed kit and Microsemi’s HiFive
Unleashed Expansion kit with their respective accessories. Microsemi's HiFive Unleashed Expansion
board enables users to create a Linux system running on a RISC-V core complex, with a large FPGA fabric
accessible through the memory map. The expansion board is shipped with a pre-configured bitstream

## System Setup and Prerequisites
Download and install the following development tools in the PC in order to design, synthesize, simulate,
and debug on the HiFive Unleashed Platform (MPFS-DEV-KIT).

### Programming FlashPro and FlashPro Express
The Microsemi FlashPro programming system is a combination of Microsemi's FlashPro software and a
hardware programmer. Together, they provide in-system programming (ISP) for all FPGA families. The
required programming and debug software is integrated with the Libero SoC PolarFire software. This
software is also available as a standalone programmer for production programming. Visit [Microsemi's
FlashPro page](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/programming/4977-flashpro#software) 
to download the standalone programmer (if needed).

| Software | Description | Hardware | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FP Express | Software for Windows and Linux | FlashPro5 | Hardware programmer for Windows and Linux |
| FlashPro | Software for Windows | FlashPro4 | Hardware programmer for Windows |

### Polarfire SoC Yocto BSP for the HiFive Unleashed Expansion Board
The Polarfire SoC Yocoto BSP builds the requried cross-compile toolchain and software to boot
a Linux system. It includes drivers for Micrsemi PCIe / I2C, SPI, QSPI, CAN and GPIO peripherals.
The build creates wic. gz file which is a compressed sector by sector copy of a bootable microSD card.
The following software applications are copied to the SD card.
 * FSBL (First Stage Boot loader)
 * Opensbi and U-boot
 * DTB (Device Tree Blob)
 * A Linux kernel image

## Board Setup
Follow the instructions to set up the HiFive Unleashed board.
1. Switch off the power button (red button in the following figure) on the HiFive Unleashed board.
Ensure the fan is plugged in.

![Power Button and Fan Connection](images/HiFive_Unleashed_board_Power_Button_and_Fan_Connection.JPG)

2. Set the pins in the DIP-switch block to the as shown in the diagram below. The ON position=0; therefore, this sets MSEL to
mode 1011, which will boot Linux automatically. See the boot modes table in Section 4 of the [HiFive Unleashed Getting Started Guide](https://sifive.cdn.prismic.io/sifive%2Ffa3a584a-a02f-4fda-b758-a2def05f49f9_hifive-unleashed-getting-started-guide-v1p1.pdf) for
more information on MSEL.

4. 
![SD Card](images/HiFive_Unleashed_Board_SD_Card.png)

4. If available, connect the board to a network switch. The board will run DHCP on boot and start an
ssh server. The MAC address is 70:b3:d5:92:fX:XX, where X:XX is replaced by the board number
converted to hexadecimal. For example, if the board is H5U-00063, then the last digits of the MAC
address are 0:3f.

![Ethernet](images/HiFive_Unleashed_Board_Ethernet.png)

5. Connect the board through USB to a developer machine. The USB connector has two serial
interfaces: the first contains the Linux console running at 115200 baud and the second provides
JTAG suitable for use with OpenOCD.
6. On the HiFive Unleashed Expansion board, update the PolarFire FPGA with the FPGA bitstream
provided. See section Software Installation and Configuration  for steps to program
the FPGA.
7. The HiFive Unleashed platform is now configured as seen in the FPGA Design in Libero section.
8. Plug-in the HiFive Unleashed board to the HiFive Unleashed Expansion board on the FMC connector.
Push the power button ON on the HiFive Unleashed board.
Note: Do not connect the power supply to the HiFive Unleashed board.

![Power Button](images/HiFive_Unleashed_Platform.jpg)

9. Connect the power supply to the HiFive Unleashed Expansion board in order to power the HiFive
Unleashed board.
10. Slide the HiFive Unleashed Expansion board’s power switch (SW3) on. Boot messages should now
appear on the console in the developer's machine.

## Building and Loading the Linux Image
For instructions on how to build and load a Linux image, see the Linux build instructions in [top level readme](../README.md).

## FPGA Design in Libero
Libero SoC Design suite provides a comprehensive design flow including traditional FPGA design flow,
embedded design flow, and graphical configurators. The suite provides a comprehensive development
environment to build embedded solutions using hard core and soft core processors.            
The FPGA design has provision to interface the PolarFire FPGA (in the HiFive Unleashed Expansion
board) with the HiFive Unleashed board using the ChipLink interface. The FPGA fabric is instantiated
with the ChipLink to AXI bridge, while peripherals (GPIO, MMUART, SPI, and I2C) are connected to it 
using the CoreAXIInterconnect, AXI to AHB, AHBLite, and CoreAPB IPs. The PolarFire PCIe AXI Slave is
connected to the AXI2CL2AXI bridge through CoreAXIInterconnect. One AXI port is exposed and marked
as unused and can connect to user logic.            
The ChipLink interface uses 125 MHz clock and AXI interface uses 75 MHz clock.           
The high-level block diagram for the Libero project implemented on the PolarFire FPGA is as seen in the
following figure.         

![Libero Project Block Diagram](images/Libero_Project_Block_Diagram.png)

More IPs are being ported on the HiFive Unleashed Platform and will be made available on request.
### Memory Map
The IPs ported on the PolarFire FPGA are accessible from the RISC-V U540 memory map as listed in the
following table. The interrupt number 42 is used for all the peripherals.
