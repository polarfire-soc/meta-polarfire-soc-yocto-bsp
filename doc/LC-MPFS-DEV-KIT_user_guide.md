## Building and Loading the Linux Image
For instructions on how to build and load a Linux image, see the Linux build instructions in [top level readme](../README.md).

### FPGA Design in Libero
The Libero project creates a Processor Subsystem in the FPGA fabric for the U540 processor.The Processor Subsystem supports the following features.
- Chiplink interface to communicate with U540SoC
- SRAM memory of size 64KB
- Peripheral controllers: SPI, MMUART, I2C and GPIO
- AXI4 slave interface to connect user AXI4 complaint slaves
In this Libero design, AXI slaves are connected to the Processor Subsystem using core AXI4 Interconnect.   

For example, 8 LSRAM blocks (each of size 64KB) are connected as AXIs laves through the core AXI4 Interconnect.The ChipLink interface uses 125 MHz clock and the AXI interface uses 75 MHz.         
The following figure shows the high-level block diagram of the Libero project implemented on the PolarFire FPGA.
