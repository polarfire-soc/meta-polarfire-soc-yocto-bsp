# Microchip PolarFire SoC Yocto BSP

Microchip Polarfire-SoC Yocto 'Board Support Package' (BSP) is based on OpenEmbedded (OE). The 'Polarfire SoC Yocto BSP' layer is build on top of the RISC-V Architectural layer (meta-riscv) to provide hardware specific features and additional disk images.
Using Yocto 'Openembedded' you will build the following:

- RISC-V Toolchain
- Predefined Disk Images
- Bootloader Binaries (FSBL / U-Boot)
- Device Tree Binary (DTB)
- Linux Kernel Images

The complete User Guides for each development platform, containing board and boot instructions, are available for the following supported platforms:

- [ICICLE-KIT-ES](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/icicle-kit-sw-developer-guide_icicle-kit-sw-developer-guide) (Icicle Kit Engineering Sample) (Requires minimum Design Tag 2023.06)
- [MPFS-VIDEO-KIT](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/boards-mpfs-sev-kit-sev-kit-user-guide) (PolarFire SoC Video Kit)

## Build Instructions

Before continuing, ensure that the prerequisite packages are present on your system. Please see the [Host PC setup for Yocto section](#Dependencies) for further details.

### Create the Workspace

This needs to be done every time you want a clean setup based on the latest BSP.

```bash
$ mkdir yocto-dev && cd yocto-dev
$ repo init -u https://github.com/polarfire-soc/polarfire-soc-yocto-manifests.git -b main -m default.xml
```

### Update the repo workspace

```bash
repo sync
repo rebase
```

### Setup Bitbake environment

```bash
. ./meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp/polarfire-soc_yocto_setup.sh
```

### Building board Disk Image

#### Building a Linux Image with a root file system (RootFS)

Using Yocto bitbake command and setting the MACHINE and image required.

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake mpfs-dev-cli
```

For instructions on how to copy the image to the eMMC or SD card refer to the [Copy the created Disk Image to a flash device](#Copy-the-created-Disk-Image-to-flash-device) section.

#### Building a RAM-based Root Filesystem (Initramfs)

Using Yocto bitbake command and setting the initramfs configuration file (conf/initramfs.conf) and the mpfs-initramfs-image

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake -R conf/initramfs.conf mpfs-initramfs-image
```

The image generated from the command above can be used to boot Linux with a RAM-based root filesystem from the eMMC or SD card.

For instructions on how to copy the image to the eMMC or SD card refer to the [Copy the created Disk Image to a flash device](#Copy-the-created-Disk-Image-to-flash-device) section.

#### Building a Linux Image for an external QSPI flash memory

The `icicle-kit-es` target machine provides support for building images suitable for programming to the oficially supported QSPI flash memories. The `core-image-minimal-mtdutils` generates a Linux image with either a `.nand.mtdimg` or `.nor.mtdimg` file extension in the `build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/icicle-kit-es/` directory.

For more information on how to enable QSPI support on PolarFire SoC, please refer to the [booting from QSPI](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/booting-from-qspi_booting-from-qspi) documentation.

##### Building a Linux image suitable for a Winbond W25N01GV NAND flash memory (Default)

When building `core-image-minimal-mtdutils`, images suitable for programming to a Winbond W25N01GV NAND flash memory will be generated by default.

Use the Yocto bitbake command to build the `core-image-minimal-mtdutils` image:

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake core-image-minimal-mtdutils
```

Supported machine target: icicle-kit-es

The created image is a '.nand.mtdimg', and is located in `yocto-dev/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/` directory.

Note: The `.nand.mtd` image generated by the BSP triggers a "free space fixup" procedure in the kernel the very first time the
file system is mounted. Therefore, the first mount might take additional time to complete.

For instructions on how to transfer the image to the external QSPI flash memory refer to the [Copy the created Disk Image to an external QSPI flash memory](#Copy-the-created-Disk-Image-to-an-external-QSPI-flash-memory) section.

##### Building a Linux image suitable for a Micron MT25QL256 NOR flash memory

To generate an image for the Micron MT25QL256 NOR flash memory, use the following setting in the Icicle Kit machine configuration file (conf/machine/icicle-kit-es.conf):

```text
UBOOT_CONFIG = "mpfs_icicle_nor"
```

Next, use the Yocto bitbake command to build the `core-image-minimal-mtdutils` image:

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake core-image-minimal-mtdutils
```

The created image is a '.nor.mtdimg', and is located in `yocto-dev/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/` directory.

Supported machine target: icicle-kit-es

For instructions on how to transfer the image to the external QSPI flash memory refer to the [Copy the created Disk Image to an external QSPI flash memory](#Copy-the-created-Disk-Image-to-an-external-QSPI-flash-memory) section.

### Copy the created Disk Image to flash device (USB mmc flash/SD/uSD)

> Be very careful while picking /dev/sdX device! Look at dmesg, lsblk, GNOME Disks, etc. before and after plugging in your usb flash device/uSD/SD to find a proper device. Double check it to avoid overwriting any of system disks/partitions!
>

We recommend using the `bmaptool` utility to program the storage device. `bmaptool` is a generic tool for creating the block map (bmap) for a file and copying files using this block map. Raw system image files can be flashed a lot faster with bmaptool than with traditional tools, like "dd" or "cp".

The created disk image is a 'wic' file, and is located in `yocto-dev/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<MACHINE>/` directory,

e.g., for mpfs-dev-cli image and machine icicle-kit-es, it will be located in

`yocto-dev/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/icicle-kit-es/mpfs-dev-cli-icicle-kit-es.wic`.

```bash
cd yocto-dev/build
bmaptool copy tmp-glibc/deploy/images/icicle-kit-es/mpfs-dev-cli-icicle-kit-es.wic /dev/sdX
```

The wic image uses a GUID Partition Table (GPT). GPT stores its primary GPT header at the start of the storage device, and a secondary GPT header at the end of the device.  The wic creation scripts do not correctly place this secondary GPT header at the current time.  To avoid later warnings about the GPT secondary header location, open the device with fdisk at this stage and rewrite the partition table:

```bash
fdisk /dev/sdX
```

This will output something like the following:

```bash
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.34).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

GPT PMBR size mismatch (13569937 != 15273599) will be corrected by write.
The backup GPT table is not on the end of the device. This problem will be corrected by write.

Command (m for help):
```

Press `w` to write the partition table and exit `fdisk`:

```bash
Command (m for help): w

The partition table has been altered.
Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
Syncing disks.
```

### Copy the created Disk Image to an external QSPI flash memory

Before proceeding with the steps shown below, make sure you have followed either the "Using a Winbond W25N01GV NAND flash memory" or
"Using a Micron MT25QL256 NOR flash memory" sections in the [booting from QSPI](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/booting-from-qspi_booting-from-qspi) documentation.

Connect to UART0 (J11), and power on the board. Settings are 115200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow control.

Press a key to stop automatic boot.  In the HSS console, type `qspi` to select the QSPI interface and then type `usbdmsc` to expose the QSPI flash memory device as a block device.

Connect the board to your host PC using J16, located beside the SD card slot.

Once this is complete, on the host PC, use `dmesg` to check what the drive identifier for the QSPI flash memory device is.

```bash
$ dmesg | egrep "sd"
```

The output should contain a line similar to one of the following lines:

```bash
[114353.477108] sd 11:0:0:0: [sdX] 65536 2048-byte logical blocks: (134 MB/128 MiB)
[114353.477111] sd 11:0:0:0: [sdX] Write Protect is off
[114353.477471] sd 11:0:0:0: [sdX] Mode Sense: 00 00 00 00
```

`sdX` is the drive identifier that should be used in the following commands, where `X` should be replaced with the specific character from the output of the previous command.

> Be very careful while picking /dev/sdX device! Look at dmesg, lsblk, GNOME Disks, etc. before and after plugging in your usb flash device/uSD/SD to find a proper device. Double check it to avoid overwriting any of system disks/partitions!
>

Once sure of the drive identifier, use the following command to copy your Linux image to the external QSPI flash memory device, replacing the X as appropriate:

For flashing a Linux image suitable for a **Winbond W25N01GV NAND** flash memory:

```bash
$ sudo dd if=tmp-glibc/deploy/images/icicle-kit-es/core-image-minimal-mtdutils-icicle-kit-es.nand.mtdimg of=/dev/sdX
```

For flashing a Linux image suitable for a **Micron MT25QL256 NOR** flash memory:

```bash
$ sudo dd if=tmp-glibc/deploy/images/icicle-kit-es/core-image-minimal-mtdutils-icicle-kit-es.nor.mtdimg of=/dev/sdX
```

When the transfer has completed, press CTRL+C in the HSS serial console to return to the HSS console.

Wait for the image transfer to complete. A progress bar will be shown in the HSS serial console.

To boot into Linux, type boot in the HSS console. U-Boot and Linux will use UART1. When Linux boots, log in with the username root. There is no password required.

### Supported Machine Targets

The `MACHINE` (board) option can be used to set the target board for which linux is built, and if left blank it will default to `MACHINE=icicle-kit-es`.
The following table details the available targets:

| `MACHINE`                  | Board Name                                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MACHINE=icicle-kit-es`    | ICICLE-KIT-ES, Icicle Kit engineering samples                         |
| `MACHINE=icicle-kit-es-amp`| ICICLE-KIT-ES, Icicle Kit engineering samples in AMP mode             |
| `MACHINE=icicle-kit-es-auth`| ICICLE-KIT-ES, Icicle Kit engineering samples with authenticated boot|
| `MACHINE=mpfs-video-kit`   | MPFS250-VIDEO-KIT, PolarFire SoC Video Kit                            |

The `icicle-kit-es-amp` machine can be used to build the Icicle Kit engineering sample with AMP support. Please see the [Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/asymmetric-multiprocessing_amp) documentation for further details.

The `icicle-kit-es-auth` machine can be used to build an image that demonstrates a simple approach
for booting an authenticated Linux kernel. Please see the [Linux Boot Authentication](https://mi-v-ecosystem.github.io/redirects/linux-boot-authentication) documentation for further details on
how to build an authentication scheme implementing a chain of trust.

When building for different 'Machines' or want a 'clean' build, we recommend deleting the 'build' directory when switching.
This will delete all cache / configurations and downloads.

```bash
cd yocto-dev
rm -rf build
```

### Linux Images

The table below summarizes the most common Linux images that can be built using this BSP.

For more information on available images refer to [Yocto reference manual](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/images.html)

#### Target machine Linux login

Login with `root` account, there is no password set.

## Bitbake commands

With the bitbake environment setup, execute the bitbake command in the following format to build the disk images.

```bash
MACHINE=<machine> bitbake <image>
```

Example building the icicle-kit-es machine and the mpfs-dev-cli Linux image

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake mpfs-dev-cli
```

To work with individual recipes:

```bash
MACHINE=<MACHINE> bitbake <recipe> -c <command>
```

View/Edit the Kernel menuconfig:

```bash
MACHINE=<MACHINE> bitbake mpfs-linux -c menuconfig
```

Run the diffconfig command to prepare a configuration fragment.
The resulting file fragment.cfg should be copied to meta-polarfire-soc-yocto-bsp/recipes-kernel/linux/files directory:
Afterwards the mpfs-linux.bb src_uri should be updated to include the <fragment>.cfg,

```bash
MACHINE=<MACHINE> bitbake mpfs-linux -c diffconfig
```

**Available BSP recipes:**

- hss (Microchip Hart Software Services) payload generator
- u-boot-mpfs (PolarFire SoC U-Boot)
- mpfs-linux (Linux Kernel for PolarFire SoC)

**Available commands:**

- clean
- configure
- compile
- install

### Yocto Image and Binaries directory

## Known issues

### Issue 001: Required binaries not available before creating the disk image

We sometimes get dependencies not building correctly.
During the process do_wic_install payload may not be present.

For example after requesting a complete build:

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake mpfs-dev-cli
```

If u-boot or boot.src.uimg or payload.bin is missing,
execute the following:

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake u-boot -c clean
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake u-boot -c install
```

And finally a complete build:

```bash
MACHINE=icicle-kit-es bitbake mpfs-dev-cli
```

### Issue 002 fs.inotify.max_user_watches

Listen uses inotify by default on Linux to monitor directories for changes. It's not uncommon to encounter a system limit on the number of files you can monitor. For example, Ubuntu Lucid's (64bit) inotify limit is set to 8192.

You can get your current inotify file watch limit by executing:

```bash
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
```

When this limit is not enough to monitor all files inside a directory, the limit must be increased for Listen to work properly.

Run the following command:

```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

[Details on max_user_watches](https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers)

See [Other Dependencies](#OtherDeps) for installation instructions.
